## Frontend Challenege

The goal of this challenge is to generate a reusable component in either React or Vue.js. This type of challenge is an example of the types of challenges you would experience in your day-to-day as a frontend engineer at PINCHme.

### Getting Started
Please clone this repository and ensure all of your work is done in a feature branch:
```
git checkout -b solutions-<your last name>
```

### The Challenge

We want you to create a reusable component that helps our members know if their review meets our requirements. Please create a simple page with the form displayed below. The component (on the right) should change as the contents of the review meet the criteria laid out in the feedback progress section.

These are the five star statuses that should occur as the user fills out the form:
